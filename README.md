# projectz
A simple blog-type website with an SQLite database and routing with flask.
A culmination of everything I have learnt while programming with the flask framework. 

It utilizes a simple SQLite database to store users, posts and the one-many relationships such as likes/dislikes and followers
Relationships are defined using classes (check model.py)
Routing is done with decorators (check views.py)

ALL HTML AND CSS ARE WRITTEN BY ME (with bootstap)

TO RUN APP: 
1. Pull project from GH
2. Navigate to main.py
3. Press run (top right button of vscode)
